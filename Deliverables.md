GCP

BigQuery was already initialized from previous projects.  I created a new dataset titled HW and a new data table named MyData.  I uploaded the .CSV file to it, and than ran a query.  I was able to expand the job details tab to see the cost and information associated with the query.

MongoDB

MongoDB was setup while following along during class.  To proceed easier I donwloaded and installed MongoCompass GUI.  After connecting I created a Database named HW and a file named MyData.  Mongo compass has a feature to install from a .csv which I did, and Compass was able to format the .csv into a MongoDB Format.  After that running queries was easy, using compass which incorporates gemini to assist in proper query syntax.
